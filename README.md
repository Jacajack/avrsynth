`avrsynth` is a project aiming to create a MIDI driven, modular 8-bit synthesizer based on AVR microcontroller and KISS rule.

Nobody knows the exact project development roadmap, but here's a short list of features that might be worth implementing:
 - Obviously LFO and some envelope generators
 - Control over MIDI
 - Loading samples through MIDI
 - MIDI drumset support
 - At least 2 sound polyphony (might likely turn out to be impossible)
 - Synthesizer modules' communication and cooperation (to handle more complex MIDI sequences)
 - **Any other ideas are welcome**
